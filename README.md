This project was designed to better understand:
- Forking and Cloning a Repository
- Working with Branches
- Merging Changes
- Using CLI for Verification
- Clean Up

This repository contains my project for CS3338 Homework 1. I forked this repo (https://github.com/JValenzuela1/CS3338-Homework-1),
cloned it with GitHub Desktop, checked out the feature-about-me branch, and updated index.html.
I committed and pushed those changes, opened a pull request from feature-about-me into my forkâ€™s main (not the original repo),
merged it, then synced main with local files via Fetch/Pull in GitHub Desktop. For verification, I generated files for git_log.txt using
git log --all --branches and repo-location.txt with the URL to this fork. Finally, I deleted the feature-about-me branch after merging.
